              <h6>b) Playing Winning</h6>


              <p>


                It is important that our users know upfront what potential winnings they could take home if they 


win, when they sign up for a game. We want your experience on the games to be seamless and have 


taken the following steps to ensure you enter a tournament with full confidence:

smooth withdrawal of money for our users. We work with trusted third-party payment gateways 


with 3-D secure authentication that guarantees the safety and security of all financial transactions. 


We do not store your financial/payment instruments like credit cards and debit cards, UPI handles, 


and wallet details with us and these are stored only with authorized technology service providers 


and entities permitted to store such data in accordance with applicable laws and regulatory 


directives.


            </p>

              We understand that gaming has the potential to be addictive, and one can lose track of time and 


money whilst playing games. But keeping the following DOs and DON’Ts in mind, you can ensure 


your love for gaming doesn’t change into an addiction:


            </p>


            <h6>DO'S</h6>





            <p>


              Play for entertainment alone, not as a source of earnings or remuneration which in any 


              manner impacts your financial independence.


            </p>





            <p>


              Decide in advance how much money you will spend playing the game and only play with 


              disposable income (i.e. such amounts of money you can afford to risk losing entirely without 


              in any way jeopardizing your current financial position


            </p>





            <p>


              Decide on the number of hours you will be devoting to the game and stick to it ensuring you 


              do not exceed such number of hours in any circumstances


            </p>





            <p>


              Set deposit limits while playing so that you never deposit more than your disposable income 


which you can afford to lose


            </p>





            <p>


              Take a break and pause playing for a while if you have lost money continuously multiple 


times





            </p>





            <p>


              Reach out to our customer care if you think you are addicted to any of our games and would 


like us to help you with dealing with your game-addiction





            </p>





            <h6>DON'TS</h6>





            <p>


              Don’t play to earn extra income


            </p>





            <p>


              Don’t play impulsively





            </p>





            <p>


              Don’t play with loaned money





            </p>





            <p>


              Don’t play if you’re not in a calm mental state. This affects your game performance 


ultimately leading you to lose money





            </p>





            <p>


              Don’t chase losses. Since all games on Battle-Boards are skill-based, take time to hone your 


skills to play better


            </p>





            <p>


              Don’t forget to keep a check on how much you are spending on the game


            </p>





            <p>


              Don’t play in between work or other engagements so you can play the game with a free 


              mind. This is also important as you don’t want this to interfere with your day-to-day life


            </p>





            <p>


              Don’t harass, threaten or abuse other players on the Platform or engage in any conduct that 


would be considered as illegal, unethical or defamatory
